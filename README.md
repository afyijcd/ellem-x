# ellem-x
ellem-x is a debian-stable based linux respin using xfce and material look. Focus is on creating a user friendly, full functional, lightweight and modern looking linux distro.

Inspired by the snappiness of crunchbang (and its successors), the looks and simplicity of chromeos, the stability of debian (stable, uch), the user friendliness of linux mint and the cleanliness of budgie.
It (for now) essentially is a install script to be installed after setting up a clean, minimal debian, and arriving at a command prompt with networking.
